``ceph-medic`` is a tool that performs checks against Ceph clusters to identify common issues preventing proper functionality. It works by comparing different nodes across a cluster and supports several systems, including Docker containers, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. It requires non-interactive SSH access to accounts that can ``sudo`` without a password prompt.
